Just learned today from this article in <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/cdc-issues-warning-about-painful-virus-mosquitoes-2D11765769\">nbcnews.com</a> that the mosquito may carry the dengue virus. Not only that virus but I guess a new virus from Africa as well. According to the article, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/www.cdc.gov/chikungunya\">Chikungunya virus</a>is also a very painful virus to get. It was found in Sint Maartin.</p>\n<p>I am including a shot of one here but I may have to take a picture with my camera when I see another one. Fortunately, we have lots of geckos in the house and they do an amazing job of eating the bugs.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Aedes_Albopictus.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Tiger Mosquitos\" width=\"1080\" height=\"733\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>",

            "content_html": "<p>Note: This post is originally from 3/24/2015 and is from my ruined Ghost blog. I am reposting some of the original content. I thought it would be fun to keep this one. We are going back to New Zealand for our 3rd time. This coming trip will be spent in Queenstown on the South Island.</p>\n<p>This is just a short blurb about vacation. We recently got back from visiting Phoenix, Los Angeles, Tahiti, and Auckland, New Zealand.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tahiti was beautiful but not that much different than our own Caribbean islands. We went to Moorea for a day trip and that island is just stunning.</li>\n<li>Getting to see even just one spring training game is awesome. I'm glad we go every year. This year we had to be at LAX the next day to fly out and so we drove to Los Angeles. The sunset was amazing. TuneIn radio worked 95% of the time and I would highly recommend it but just once.</li>\n<li>New Zealand was even more beautiful than I expected and Auckland was an extremely modern city. I got to try a Flat White for the first time and just fell in love with the drink. We also went to Wahiki island off of Auckland and that provided us with even more beauty. Especially since we walked most of it. The wineries everywhere were top-notch.</li>\n<li>A layover in Tahiti and Los Angeles on the way back wasn't too bad. In Tahiti, they took my travel corkscrew. First time in over 5 years I have had it taken on me and this was obviously my 2nd time in that airport! For Los Angeles, we just drove around near the water and checked out some of the scenery.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think sums it up. I have some amazing pictures and memories and very happy to have had the opportunity to take this trip.</p>",

I will have to check that out.</p>\n<p>Lets see if I can shorten this:</p>\n<p>Ghost is a new blogging platform and I didn't really have the time (I technically still don't) to try and install it. It has taken a solid 1.5 hours to get it up and running on my little server but it seems to be working.</p>\n<p>There are 2 possible issues. The first is I am not sure if I am saving this in mysql or sqlite. It is suppose to be mysql. The second is the upstart functionality. When I reboot my server I can't seem to verify ghost will restart. Again, this is something I will have to test later.</p>\n<p>Lastly, this is being housed on an atom server running on Ubuntu 13.10.</p>\n<p>I repurposed an Acer Veriton with an atom processor. Replaced the expensive fan and added an SSD and doubled the memory. It also serves as a remote desktop host with virtualbox running an XP guest. I also occasionally use it to stream video to the TV. It sits behind the TV and is silent. You may think that putting an SSD in it is overkill but when you are paying 52.5 cents (soon to go up another 2.5 cents) per Kwh you would also be doing everything to reduce your electricity costs.</p>",

Volume Down + Power. Hold it down until the light starts to flash.</p>\n<p>My soundbar had two issues. The Hisense Soundbar would not turn off and after a few minutes it went super quiet. I did the standard troubleshooting and then opened a ticket with Hisense. It took them just a day or two to send a text message asking for a pic of the label. I originally did the chat support.</p>\n<p>A week goes by and I reach out to them again. They say I have to ship it in. I did not have the original box but I did find a box it would fit in. However, it would have cost me close to $30 to ship it out.</p>\n<p>The positive of this situation is either 1. don't buy hisense again (our tv is hisense also) or 2. thank heavens I don't have to pay to ship it back to get it fixed.</p>\n<p>The negative is that Hisense support should have suggested I hit those two buttons. They did ask me to unplug and plug it back in.  This is huge mistake on their part. It would have cost them time and money to press those two buttons and ship it back. You know that's all they would have done.</p>\n<p>The old saying \"You get what you paid for\" lives on. Here is verifiable proof.</p>",

Especially with El Nino being back. Our lows have been around 80 for a month now. That should not happen until August/September. </p>\n<p>What I do for my cold brew is use a cotton bag and make a mason jar worth of cold brew. I leave it to sit in the kitchen for around 20 hours. Three days worth goes to work with me on Monday and the rest is either drank by the wife or saved for the weekend.</p>\n<p>I vary my recipe based on what I have. When I would make 10 gallons for special events I did a ratio of sweet, nutty and chocolatey.  PNG, Ethiopian, Brazil, Colombian and Guatamela are the usual countries. Currently, I have been using Mexican Chiapas, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and/or Colombian. The Chiapas I have right now is last season's crop. Got a great price on it. I can't taste the difference when using it in cold brew.</p>\n<p>Enjoy a cold brew in this hot summer!</p>",
